1. The IDs provide a unique way of referencing the process, and the group IDs provide a way of referencing the group the process belong too; in case you want to an operation on a bunch of processes at once, you can use the group ids.
Effective IDs are used to evaluate permissions for the process.

2. They show zero time because the processes are running so fast, in nanoseconds, that they normally wouldn't be picked up upon, and sleeping a process doesn't actually add to its running time.

Note: In my code, I include lengthy loops between the time statents and I still observe zero time values occasionally.
